# Discogs add all of format to wantlist


Due to [this thread](http://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/363499) being unfulfilled after 2+ years, I decided to use this as an oppourtunity to teach myself some jquery (I am a novice).


You can install this .user.js file as a [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script. It should run on all 'master' release pages on discogs.


In the future, I plan on dynamically populating the format buttons, but it currently supports releases with 'CD', 'LP', or 'Cass' in the format string. I also plan on making it look a bit better, and perhaps making it into a chrome extension.

It ignores 'Unofficial' releases.
